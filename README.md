# 🚦 Road Safety Analysis & EDA Using ESP (Excel, SQL, Power BI)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road casualties and accidents using the ESP stack — **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend visualization, and dashboard creation to highlight key patterns and metrics in road safety across different locations and timeframes.

## 📂 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Excel** – For initial data inspection, filtering, and formatting
- **SQL (MySQL)** – For data cleaning, transformation, KPI extraction, and advanced analysis
- **Power BI** – For creating dynamic dashboards and visual storytelling
- **ESP Stack** – A self-coined abbreviation for Excel, SQL, Power BI used throughout this project

## 🧠 Skills Applied

- Data Cleaning (missing values, outliers, type conversions)
- EDA (univariate and bivariate)
- SQL Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions
- KPI Generation and Metric Tracking
- Data Modeling for Power BI
- Interactive Dashboards and Slicers
- Geographic Heatmaps and Visualizations

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed records of road accidents and casualties, with fields such as:

- **Date of Incident**
- **Location Type (Urban/Rural)**
- **Road Type & Surface**
- **Light & Weather Conditions**
- **Casualty Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)**
- **Vehicle Types Involved**
- **Accident Reference ID**

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- ✅ Total Number of Accidents
- ✅ Total Casualties
- ✅ Fatalities, Serious, and Slight Injuries
- ✅ Urban vs. Rural Accident Split
- ✅ Casualties by Vehicle Type
- ✅ Casualties by Road Surface & Light Conditions
- ✅ Time-based Trends (Monthly, Yearly)
- ✅ Geographical Distribution via Heatmaps

## 🔁 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Raw datasets were gathered from official road safety records
2. **Preprocessing in Excel** – Format cleaning, filtering unnecessary columns
3. **Data Transformation in SQL** – Used MySQL for:
   - Column renaming
   - Filtering null or inconsistent entries
   - Creating custom flags (e.g., `Is_Two_Wheeler`, `Is_Night_Time`)
   - Aggregations and KPI tables
4. **Visualization in Power BI** – 
   - Used Power Query for modeling
   - Created dynamic dashboards
   - Applied filters, slicers, and drilldowns
